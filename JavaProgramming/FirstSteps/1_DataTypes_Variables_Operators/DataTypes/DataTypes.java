         A data type is the most basic and the most common classification of data.
         It is this through which the compiler gets to know the form or the type of information that will be used throughout the code.
         So basically data type is a type of information transmitted between the programmer and the compiler where
         the programmer informs the compiler about what type of data is to be stored
         and also tells how much space it requires in the memory.

         A data type specifies a set of values, and possible operations on these values.
         It is important to state at the outset that Java is a strongly typed language.
         Indeed, part of Java’s safety and robustness comes from this fact.
         First, every variable has a type, every expression has a type, and every type is strictly defined.
         Second, all assignments, whether explicit or via parameter passing in method calls, are checked for type compatibility.
         There are no automatic coercions or conversions of conflicting types as in some languages.
         The Java compiler checks all expressions and parameters to ensure that the types are compatible.
         Any type mismatches are errors that must be corrected before the compiler will finish compiling the class.

         Java has two main kinds of data types: class types and primitive types.
         Class type is a data type for objects of a class.
         Primitive type are simpler than objects which have both data and methods.
         A value of a primitive type is an indecomposable value.

         Java defines eight primitive types of data: byte, short, int, long, char, float, double, and boolean.
         The primitive types are also commonly referred to as simple types.
         These can be put in four groups:
         • Integers This group includes byte, short, int, and long, which are for whole-valued signed numbers.
         • Floating-point numbers This group includes float and double, which represent numbers with fractional precision.
         • Characters This group includes char, which represents symbols in a character set, like letters and numbers.
         • Boolean This group includes boolean, which is a special type for representing true/false values.
         You can use these types as-is, or to construct arrays or your own class types.
         Thus, they form the basis for all other types of data that you can create.
         The primitive types represent single values—not complex objects.
         Although Java is otherwise completely object-oriented, the primitive types are not.

         PRIMITIVE TYPES:

         byte (integer) -> 1 byte
         short (integer)-> 2 bytes
         int (integer) -> 4 bytes
         long (integer) -> 8 bytes
         float(floating-point) -> 4 bytes
         double(floating-point) -> 8 bytes
         char (single Unicode character) -> 2 bytes
         boolean (true or false) -> 1 or more bytes
