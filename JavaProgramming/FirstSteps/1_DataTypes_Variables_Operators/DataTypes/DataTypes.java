        a data type specifies a set of values, and possible operations on these values.
        Java has two main kinds of data types: class types and primitive types.
        Class type is a data type for objects of a class.
         Primitive type are simpler than objects which have both data and methods.
         A value of a primitive type is an indecomposable value.

         PRIMITIVE TYPES:

         byte (integer) -> 1 byte
         short (integer)-> 2 bytes
         int (integer) -> 4 bytes
         long (integer) -> 8 bytes
         float(floating-point) -> 4 bytes
         double(floating-point) -> 8 bytes
         char (single Unicode character) -> 2 bytes
         boolean (true or false) -> 1 or more bytes
