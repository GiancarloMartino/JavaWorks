         Technical term for a name in a programming language is IDENTIFIER.
         Java is case sensitive, so when choose an IDENTIFIER we must consider uppercase and lowercase.

         The first character in an identifier cannot be a digit. No dot or asterisk.
         There is no limit to the length.
